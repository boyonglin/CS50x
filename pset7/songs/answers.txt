1. If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

> SELECT AVG(energy), AVG(valence), AVG(danceability) FROM songs;
+-------------+--------------+-------------------+
| AVG(energy) | AVG(valence) | AVG(danceability) |
+-------------+--------------+-------------------+
| 0.65906     | 0.484443     | 0.71646           |
+-------------+--------------+-------------------+

With normal high energy and danceability and less than half of the valence, it should be a slow rock that needs to return to itself. So I chose green as the 2018 audio aura.
Green: Calm, analytical, and introspective are the traits that describe a green aura. These listeners gravitate toward complex music to tame their fast-moving minds. (Spotify, 2021, Learn More About the Audio Aura in Your Spotify 2021 Wrapped With Aura Reader Mystic Michaela)


2.Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

Consider tempo user survey results.
